## Jalali calendar

Let's start by displaying a very simple Jalali calendar using react-shamsi. We do it by import the styles and the component itself like so:

```jsx
import { Calendar } from "@react-shamsi/calendar";
import "@react-shamsi/calendar/dist/styles.css";

export default function Example() {
  return <Calendar />;
}
```

### Configuration

Now we are going to explore every single prop that could be passed to Calendar.
